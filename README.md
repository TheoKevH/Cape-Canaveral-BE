## Project Description

ðŸš€ **Cape Canaveral**

**Cape Canaveral** is a task management platform that helps you launch your work missions with precision. I was inspired by Asana, so I tried to create a task management site with Kanban Board feature. Here, you can create boards, columns, and tasks.
